## 
Clean the data (eg. convert M and F to 0 and 1). You can do this with code or simple find and replace . 

Develop a correlation map using a heatmap and discuss major observations.

Pick two of the most correlated features (negative and positive) and create a scatter plot with ring-age. Discuss major observations. 

Create histograms of the two most correlated features, and the ring-age. What are the major observations?

Create a 60/40 train/test split - which takes a random seed based on the experiment number to create a new dataset for every experiment.
